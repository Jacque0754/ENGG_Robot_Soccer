# ENGG1000 Robot Soccer
Robot soccer is a project that combines electrics, mechanic and computing together. To work efficiently, the project is separated into the three stream with two people in each. The final prototype of the robot has three wheels, one concave area in front for kicking the ball and three sensors for detecting color, distance and the movement of the ball. Having all these parts above, our robot can perform following required tasks: 
  1. Find the ball
  2. Kick the ball
  3. Shoot the ball towards the goal
  4. Defend the goal
  5. Follow a moving ball
